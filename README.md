# ReCovNet
This project is the code for the study: ReCovNet: Reinforcement Learning with Covering Information for Solving Maximal Coverage Billboards Location Problem.

## Quick start
You can run [GA](https://github.com/HIGISX/ReCovNet/blob/master/Billboard_MCLP_GA.ipynb) to quickly implement GA to solve MBCLP.
You can run [GUROBI](https://github.com/HIGISX/ReCovNet/blob/master/Billboard_MCLP_solver.ipynb) to quickly implement GUROBI to solve MBCLP. (Ensure that you have installed Gurobi and obtained a valid license.)
You can run [ReCovNet](https://github.com/HIGISX/ReCovNet/blob/master/Billboards_MCLP_DRL.ipynb) to quickly implement ReCovNet to solve MBCLP. (Dependencies required)
